# External Rocket Resources

> [!Warning]
> Work in progress!
> I'm new to this so the list is still very incomplete, as the time goes on I will improve this document with your and my contributions

*What is this?* This is a compilation of helpful resources about rockets that are meant to complement the internal resources from previous years.

*Why, tho?* To have a centralized go-to document for any queries.

*Who is it for?* For everyone! Although it will be more useful for newer members.

*How can I contribute?* If you have any personal recommendations, feel free to add them by creating a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) or contact me. You can add, remove and modify existing links or refactor the document.
